Employee Payroll System â€“ Python OOP CRUD

This is a simple Python project that demonstrates the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) along with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
branches are

-----main------
------ create-feature-----
------read-feature-----
------update-feature-----
------delete-feature----

Each CRUD operation was implemented in a separate Git branch* and later merged into the `main` branch.
